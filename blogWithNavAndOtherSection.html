                <h1>The Secret to a Flourishing Life is Meditating on Scripture</h1>
                <p>If you could choose one daily habit that would transform the direction of your life, what would it
                    be?
                    Psalm 1 offers a surprising answer: meditate on God’s Word, day and night. In a world obsessed with
                    quick fixes and instant results, this ancient wisdom invites us into a deeper, slower rhythm—one
                    that
                    roots us like a tree by streams of water, making us unshakeable and fruitful in every season.</p>

            <section class="two">
                <h1>Why Meditation Matters</h1>
                <p><a href="http://">Psalm 1:2</a> describes the “happy” person as one whose “delight is in the
                    instruction of the Lord, and
                    on
                    his instruction he meditates day and night.” The Hebrew word for “meditate” here isn’t about
                    emptying
                    your mind, but about filling it—chewing on God’s words, letting them shape your thoughts, desires,
                    and
                    actions. It’s not a legalistic box to check, but a way of life that leads to true happiness and
                    resilience. Our delight is what we meditate and feed on! If you are hearing this and that’s not you
                    today—you don’t delight in God’s word. That’s okay! Where you are today does not have to be where
                    you
                    are tomorrow! That’s gospel! That’s good news! Treat this like an experiment.</p>

                <h1>If you’ve ever felt the tension between respecting governing authorities and living out your
                    allegiance to King Jesus, you’re not alone.</h1>
                <p>We live in some of the most politically charged and polarizing environments. As Christ-followers,
                    we’re called to uniquely be of two worlds simultaneously. Like a spiritual amphibian, we are both
                    citizens of earth and citizens of heaven <a href="">(Philippians 1:27; 3:20)</a>. In <a
                        href="">Romans 13:1–7</a>,
                    Paul gives
                    instruction to the church in Rome, the heart of the empire, to live in submission and honor to
                    governing authorities. For many of us, we read this passage with our own set of caveats. Let’s be
                    honest, we have a different take on this passage depending on if the person we voted for is in
                    office or not! But Paul’s instruction is not for submission, if you like the rulers. And that’s
                    where the challenge for us lies. How do we live as dual citizens of heaven and earth? Here are just
                    a few thoughts inspired from Scripture to lead us the right way..</p>
            </section>
            <section class="two">
                <h1>Respect governing rulers, even if you hold disagreements with them.</h1>
                <p>Paul did! Mind you, Paul would have KNOWN how evil governments could be! He saw the government
                    unlawfully take the life of some of his friends. Many Christians died for their confession the first
                    300 years of the church. He himself would eventually be executed under the orders of emperor Nero.
                    Note, too, many historians would consider Nero to have been clinically insane by our modern
                    conventions. His rulership was not kind or sensible. Yet, Paul wrote the letter to the Romans (with
                    chapter 13 being in it) while Nero reigned as the sovereign over the empire. So, however we read
                    this passage, we CAN NOT read it as blindly, blissfully living under the governments of the nations
                    we find ourselves in. That was not the experience of the readers of Paul’s letters, nor is it ours.
